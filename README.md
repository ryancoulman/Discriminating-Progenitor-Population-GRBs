# Project Abstract


The recent detection of the long-duration, merger originating GRB211211A and GRB230307A has sparked a renewed interest in means to discriminate the progenitor population of GRBs based on their gamma-ray light curve alone. Traditional classification schemes, reliant solely on temporal and spectral properties to group GRBs into long and short bursts associated with stellar collapse and compact binary mergers, respectively, have proven inadequate in accurately discerning these anomalous GRBs. Building upon previous work, we utilise Haar wavelets to measure the variability of the bulk emission and systematically apply the technique in a novel manner to pulses preceding the main event, termed precursors. We find the former analysis of the prompt emission unable to disseminate the anomalous population, whereas the latter study of precursors correctly demonstrates clustering of the anomalies with the short merger population. Therefore, by utilising precursors, our work aids in the accurate classification of GRBs, which is essential for leveraging these bursts to understand star formation, metal enrichment, and the universeâ€™s evolution.

## Features

- **Object-Orientatied Programming :** Calculates Bessel functions of the first kind $J_{m}(x)$ for orders $m = 0$ to $m = 9$.
- **Error handling:** Generates high-precision values suitable for scientific and engineering applications.
- **Tabular Data Output:** Outputs results in a tabular format for easy analysis and interpretation.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Object-Orientatied Programming:** Utilises functional C programming for mathematical calculations.
- **Error Handling:** Implements the CTR to approximate the integral to a high degree of accuracy using $N = 10,000$ sub-intervals.
- **Handling Data-Sets:** using **Pandas** 
- **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy:** Develops efficient algorithms to perform complex mathematical computations.
- **Web-Scraping:** Once calcuated, samples the Bessel function at varied m and x values using a smaller N to verify the precision to the number of decimal places rquested by the user, improving computational efficiency by reducing N when possible if the output is unchanged.
- **Parralel-Core Processing:**


## Code Overview

### Main Program (`main.c`)

- Defines and initializes necessary variables and constants.
- Computes Bessel functions for orders $m = 0$ to $m = 9$.
- Outputs the results in a structured tabular format to `Bessel_Output.txt`.

### Output File (`Bessel_Output.txt`)

- Contains computed Bessel function values for $x$ ranging from 0 to 99.
- Organized in a table where each row corresponds to a different $x$ value, and each column corresponds to a Bessel function of a particular order.
